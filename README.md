# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
### V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results: 
![Total Fare by City Type](/analysis/Challenge_fare_summary.png)
### -Total Weekly Fare is hiher in Urban area, Suburban area, then Rural area. Ranges for Monthly Fare by city types are as follows:
#### Urban: $1,600-$2,500
#### Suburban: $750-$1,400
#### Rural: $50-$500
## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
### Recommendation 1: The total fare is higher in the highly-concentrated area: Urban > Suburban > Rural.  Fare revenue opportunites are almost 10x in Urban and almost 5x in Suburban, compared to Rural area.  More drivers should be allocated to the area in higher density to maximize the fare revenue opportunities, 
### Recommendation 2: Rural area has higher fare per ride, because the riders use PyBer for longer distance than Urban or Suburban area.  Though these drivers have less frequecy to drive out, each driver will be driving longer distance (=higher fare), thus working shift for Rural area should be for longer period with less number of shifts.
### Recommendation 3: It is recommended to provide incentives for number of ride than ride distance, because drivers earn less per ride in Urban area, almost by one-thrid.
